# Project Name
NISARGAH 2021  
An event portal is a solution that lets people design, create, discover, catalog, share, visualize, secure, and manage events and event-driven applications. Here this is a project which shows a new method of our needs.We are presenting our project about the creation of an event portal in our own college using simple python language which is very useful for our coming generation.This Event Management System Project in Django created using Python Django Framework on the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend. It has user authentication features for login/registration, as well as a user dashboard for displaying and registering for events.

An Events Management System is a full-stack Django web application that offers a clean, descriptive, and interactive user interface for viewing and registering for various events. It has responsive pages and tabs for viewing, handling, and enrolling in various events.
A key benefit of using Event Portal is its ability to track the relationships that exist in an extremely decoupled event-driven architecture (EDA). It enables the reuse of schemas and events, and graphically presents the relationships that exist between applications and events.

## How it Works ?
1. When we login to our portal we can see two pages one is Admin and the other is Registration.To open admin page type "/admin" in url and to go registration page type "/scm/registration" in url. 
2. In admin page it includes features like:
          Login and Logout – By default the admin need to login first to access the system and also the admin can logout.
          Manage Events Booking – For the events booking, the admin can view all the user who registered for the booking events.
          Manage Events – For the events, the admin can add, update, delete events information.    
   In registration page it include freatura like:
          Registration – the user need to register first to have an account before he/she can login in the system
          Login – the user need to login first to access the system.
          Book Events – the user can register to book an events.
